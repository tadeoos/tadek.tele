I live in <a class="tiptext">Warsaw<iframe class="description" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"></iframe></a> on the 8th floor of a big post-prl 10-flats high concrete moloch. The view is absolutely amazing. And the radiators need a little fixing. Next to my room lives my friend <a class="tiptext">Adam<iframe class="description" src="http://adamboro.com/blog"></iframe></a> who is a selt-taught Acadaemy of Fine Arts graduate front-end developer currently working at <a class="tiptext">Daftcode<iframe class="description" src="http://daftcode.com"></iframe></a>. He also recently developed a thing for <a class="tiptext">elm<iframe class="description" src="http://elm-lang.org/"></iframe></a> so <a class="tiptext">react<iframe class="description" src="https://facebook.github.io/react/"></iframe></a> may get a little jelous.

In a hot and dry summer the riverbanks turn from flyblowned to active and spontanoues hub of drinking, talking and dancing. <a class="tiptext">Barges become clubs<iframe class="description" src="http://m.natemat.pl/a02dfed630aef1e9e853ead590a8dc1d,640,0,0,0.jpg"></iframe></a> and you have dozen of bars and food tracks spread over a mile-long piece of coast. And that's only a west-side of the story. The <a class="tiptext">east one<iframe class="description" src="http://p2.wawalove.pl/p2.wawalove.pl/0e0a72e0e8d1b38b1ac5f227897d6624.jpg"></iframe></a> is
