I live in <a class="tiptext">Warsaw<iframe class="description" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"></iframe></a> on the 8th floor of a big post-prl 10-flats high concrete moloch. The view is absolutely amazing. And the radiators need a little fixing. Next to my room lives my friend <a class="tiptext">Adam<iframe class="description" src="http://adamboro.com/blog"></iframe></a> who is a selt-taught Acadaemy of Fine Arts graduate front-end developer currently working at <a class="tiptext">Daftcode<iframe class="description" src="http://daftcode.com"></iframe></a>. He also recently developed a thing for <a class="tiptext">elm<iframe class="description" src="http://elm-tutorial.org"></iframe></a> so [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) may get a little jelous.

Warsaw is an interesting city to live in. Almost entirely rebuild after World War II in a [socreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism) manner. Only the Old Town was rebuild as a replica. The city center lays on the hill little to the left, west of the Vistula's riverbank.
