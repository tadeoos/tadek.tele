I live in [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw) on the 8th floor of a big post-prl 10-flats high concrete moloch. The view is absolutely amazing. And the radiators need a little fixing. Next to my room lives my friend [Adam](http://adamboro.com) who is a selt-taught Acadaemy of Fine Arts graduate front-end developer currently working at [Daftcode](http://daftcode.com). He also recently developed a thing for [elm](http://elm-tutorial.org).
